# E-Commerce-Brazilian-Portofolio

**Data E-Commerce Brazilian by Olist Store**
This project use dataset from Kaggle which had 100k+ data orders from 2016 - 2018. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, 
payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates 
Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones 
great houses.

**What I looking for?**
In this project I conducted exploratory data to find out all the data needed for analysis. After doing data exploration, I selected the data that will be used to visualize the 
data. Before doing the visualization, I cleaned the data with Excel for the data results that I had made. After that, I used Tableau to visualize the data that I had compiled 
using SQL. In my view, the data I describe is in the form of Ratings and Products from customer purchases where I want to know the average Rating from each country and see 
products that are often purchased by customers so that from the results of this analysis I can find out what is trending and can increase sales in e-commerce.
